# Concept
* VSMs -- value streaming maps
* DevOps isn't a team or job title, a emthodology, specific piece of software, a quick fix for an org's challengesd. 
  * **DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users.**
* Practices
  * **Agile planning**: create backlogs, priortize the items.
  * **Continuous integration (CI)**: We'll automate how we build and test our code. We'll run that every time a team member commits changes to version control.
  * **Continuous delivery (CD):** CD is how we test, configure, and deploy from a build to a QA or production environment.
  * **Monitoring:** We'll use telemetry to get information about an application's performance and usage patterns. We can use that information to improve as we iterate.
